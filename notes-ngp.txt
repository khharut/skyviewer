Must be compiled/linked against a QT4 compiled version of libQGLViewer

Easy enough to do.
Assume I have such a version in /home/phillips/libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3-qt4/
Then 

/usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake INCLUDE_DIR=/home/phillips/libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3-qt4/include LIB_DIR=/home/phillips/libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3-qt4/lib
make
export export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/phillips/libQGLViewer-2.2.6-3-qt4/lib
./skyviewer

Notes from using it:
	- 'New' should be 'Open'
	- Should be able to select from a list of previously opened files
	- There should be a 'New' that opens a new viewer window
	- For information icon, should say 'Info'. 'Inf' looks like infinity.
		Could be confusion wrt to FITS and bad pixel values/infinite pixs values
	- Polarization vectors are enabled even when the map has no P data

	- Range dialog is funky, and not in a 'going to funkytown' way.
		o Have 'Min Auto-track' off, slide 'Max' < 0, now turn
		  auto-track on. Bad behavior follows, gets confused

		o Should 'Rescale' be called 'Reset'? It looks like its
		  resetting the display range, not changing the scaling
		  of the map.

		o This is the big one. We will have to think how to do this
		  right. The Min/Max sliders are completely non-responsive after
		  any movement. They stay this way until the texture is fully
		  updated. Makes it maddening to fine tune the range.

		  What we need to do is have the texture update run in a separate
		  thread. Any new movement of the sliders kills the old thread
		  and starts a new one. This way the GUI is always getting CPU time
		  and  its feel is responsive. Also, the displayed range will more
		  closely in time track the user's input. (After killing the old
		  thread and starting a new one, we could update the GL texture,
		  this way the user is getting partial feedback on range changes)
